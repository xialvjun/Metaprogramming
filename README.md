# Metaprogramming
<h3>
Metaprogramming in Dart
</h3>
<p>
The OZClass lets you create objects that are able to dynamically add methods and properties. This feature is useful
in some cases; for instance:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Objects that <strong>learn</strong> methods</li>
  <li>Objects that delete their properties</li>
  <li>Objects that create properties</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the <strong>examples</strong> folder there are some examples that show you how to use the class. Anyway,
your imagination is the limit, Have fun!
